    <a href="letterspacing.html"><p class="triangle">The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite,
      perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries. In the center of each gallery
      is a ventilation shaft, bounded by a low r,ailing. From any hexagon one can
      see the floors above and below-one after another, endlessly. The arrangement of the galleries is always the same: Twenty bookshelves, five to each
      side, line four of the hexagon's six sides; the height of the bookshelves, floor
      to ceiling, is hardly greater than the height of a normal librarian. One of the
      hexagon's free sides opens onto a narrow sort of vestibule, which in turn
      opens onto another gallery, identical to the first-identical in fact to all.
      To the left and right of the vestibule are two tiny compartments. One is
      for sleeping, upright; the other, for satisfying one's physical necessities.
      Through this space, too, there passes a spiral staircase, which winds upward
      and downward into the remotest distance. </p></a>

        that sheltered Him? Someone proposed searching by regression: To locate
        book A, first consult book B, which tells where book A can be found; to locate book B, first consult book C, and so on, to infinity .... It is in ventures
        such as these that I have squandered and spent my years. I cannot think it
        unlikely that there is such a total book3 on some shelf in the universe. I pray
        to the unknown gods that some man-even a single man, tens of centuries
        ago-has perused and read that book. </p>

He showed his find to a traveling decipherer, who told him that the lines were written in Portuguese; others said it was Yiddish. Within the century experts had determined what the language actually was: a Samoyed-Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with inflections from classical Arabic. The content was also determined: the rudiments of combinatory analysis, illustrated with examples of endlessly repeating variations. Those examples allowed a librarian of genius to discover the fundamentalbrary, there are no two identical books. From those incontrovertible premises, the librarian deduced that the Library is "total"-perfect, </p></div>

    <div id="column3plus"><p>. I declare that the Library is endless. Idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are the necessary
      shape of absolute space, or at least of our perception of space. They argue
      that a triangular or pentagonal chamber is inconceivable. (Mystics claim
      that their ecstasies reveal to them a circular chamber containing an enormous circular book with a continuous spine that goes completely around
      the walls. But their testimony is suspect, their words obscure. That cyclical
      book is God.) Let it suffice for the moment that I repeat the classic dictum:
      The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any hexagon and whose circumference is unattainable. </p></div>
